Homeworld is a real-time strategy video game developed by Relic Entertainment and published by Sierra Studios (co-founder pictured) in 1999 for Microsoft Windows. The science fiction game follows exiles on a spacecraft-constructing mothership who aim to reclaim their ancient homeworld, encountering pirates, mercenaries, traders, and rebels along the way. The player's fleet carries over between levels, and can travel in a fully three-dimensional space. Alex Garden of Relic served as the game's director, and Luke Moloney was lead programmer. Metacritic lists Homeworld as the highest rated computer game of 1999 and the third-highest on any platform for the year, although critical opinions were divided on its plot and high difficulty. The game sold over 500,000 copies in its first six months, and received several awards and nominations for best strategy game of the year and best game of the year. Gearbox Software purchased the game rights in 2013 and released a remastered collection in 2015.

W. Somerset Maugham (25 January 1874 – 16 December 1965) was an English writer. He achieved national celebrity as a playwright; by 1908 he had four plays running simultaneously in London's West End. After 1933 he concentrated on novels and short stories. His popularity provoked adverse reactions from highbrow critics, and many belittled him as merely competent. More recent assessments generally rank Of Human Bondage as a masterpiece, and his short stories are held in high critical regard. Maugham's plain prose became known for its lucidity, but his reliance on clichés attracted adverse critical commentary. During World War I Maugham worked for the British Secret Service, later drawing on his experiences for stories published in the 1920s. He married Syrie Wellcome in 1917, and they had a daughter, Liza. However, his principal partner was Gerald Haxton; after Haxton's death, Alan Searle became Maugham's secretary and companion. Maugham gave up writing novels after World War II and died in 1965.
